# Pathfinder
This application lets you visualize pathfinding algorithms, which are used to find the shortest path between any two given points. You can find the application here: https://pathfindingapp.herokuapp.com/

## Algorithms Used

#### Djkstra's Algorithm:
 A very popular weighted algorithm for finding the shortest path from a starting node to a target node.The algorithm creates a tree of shortest paths from the starting vertex, the source, to all other points in the graph.
#### Astar(A*) Algorithm:
 It is an informed search algorithm, as it uses information about path cost and also uses heuristics to find the solution. It is agruably one of the best pathfinding algorithms and it is much faster than Djkstra.
 
#### Breadth First Search (BFS) Algorithm:
It is a great algorithm and guarantees shortest path. It starts at the source node, and explores all of the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.

#### Depth First Search (DFS) Algorithm:
Not a good algorithm for path finding. The DFS algorithm is a recursive algorithm that uses the idea of backtracking. It involves exhaustive searches of all the nodes by going ahead, if possible, else by backtracking.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
